# Test Data for Telemetry Stack

Based on <https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/get-started/quick-start/tutorial> and <https://github.com/grafana/loki-fundamentals?tab=readme-ov-file>, this stack generates some test data for the telemetry stack.

In this `test-logs` stack, Grafana Alloy has been configured to tail logs from all Docker containers and forward them to Loki.
